"""The appworld port's runtime seams: provisioning order, concurrency, and what blocks the loop.

Offline and upstream-free. Every failure defended here was found by running the port rather than
by reading it, and each is the kind that looks like nothing until the day it matters: a cold CI
runner that hangs instead of provisioning, two forks of one clone deriving the same task at the
same moment, a finalizer that stops every other episode while it waits, a cache path that produces
a tree of links resolving to nothing.
